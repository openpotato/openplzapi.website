The OpenPLZ API data directory for [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland) includes street names, postal codes, localities, and administrative divisions (communes, districts, and cantons).

## Administrative Structure

Switzerland's administrative structure is characterised by a strong federalist system. It is divided into three levels, each with distinct competencies and responsibilities.

**Confederation (Bund)**

:   The highest administrative unit of the Swiss federal state. The Confederation is responsible for overarching matters such as foreign policy, national defense, and the Swiss legal system. The legislature is formed by the Federal Assembly (National Council and Council of States), and the executive branch is led by the Federal Council.

**Cantons (Kantone)**

:   The federal units below the Confederation, consisting of 26 cantons (20 full cantons and 6 half-cantons). Each canton has its own constitution, government, parliament, and courts. Cantons have significant autonomy, particularly in education, healthcare, and policing.

**Communes (Gemeinden)**

:   The smallest administrative units with extensive self-governing authority. There are approximately 2,000 communes in Switzerland, though the number is steadily decreasing due to mergers. Communes manage local affairs such as spatial planning, schools, and water supply. They are governed by local authorities, typically including a local council and an administrative office.
