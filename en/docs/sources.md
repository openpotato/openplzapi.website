The data basis for **OpenPLZ API** is completely based on public sources of the countries as well as on data of the [OpenStreetMap project](https://www.openstreetmap.de/). The sources are listed in detail below.

## Germany

### Municipality directory

The [Federal Statistical Office (Destatis)](https://www.destatis.de) provides the *Gemeindeleitdatei GV100* for download. This file contains information on all regional units of Germany (federal states, administrative districts, counties, associations of municipalities and municipalities). The GV100 file is a text file with a fixed record structure of 220 digits that is updated regularly.

### Street directory

In Germany, there is no freely accessible database to obtain all postcodes and/or street names in Germany. There are commercial services that offer such data, but they cost money and may not become Open Data. 

An alternative is the community-run [OpenStreetMap project](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). Every week, a new and complete copy of all data in OpenStreetMap is made available both as a compressed XML file and in [PBF format (Protocolbuffer Binary Format)](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PBF_Format). All info on this can be found at [Planet OSM](https://planet.openstreetmap.org). The database file is very large, so OpenPLZ API works with a regional extract for Germany. The streets are extracted with all relevant information from the OpenStreetMap data and linked with the data from the GV-ISys. The result is a CSV file that has been given its place [in the following GitHub repo](https://github.com/openpotato/openplzapi.data) and is updated regularly.
