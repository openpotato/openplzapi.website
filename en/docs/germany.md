The OpenPLZ API data directory for [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany) includes street names, postal codes, localities, and administrative divisions (municipalities, municipal associations, districts, government regions, and federal states).

## Administrative Structure

Germany's administrative structure is based on a federal system governed by the Basic Law (Grundgesetz). It is divided into several levels, each with specific competencies and responsibilities.

**Federation (Bund)**

:   The highest level of administration and legislation in Germany. The federation is responsible for overarching matters such as foreign policy, defense, and monetary order. Legislation is carried out by the Bundestag and Bundesrat, while the executive branch is headed by the federal government.

**Federal States (Bundesländer)**

:   The federal units below the federation, consisting of 16 federal states. Each state has its own constitution, government, and state parliament. The states have exclusive competencies, particularly in areas such as education, police, and cultural affairs.

**Government Regions (Regierungsbezirke)**

:   A middle level of administration positioned between the state and district levels in some federal states. Government regions exist in only four of the 16 federal states and primarily coordinate state administration. They do not have independent legislative powers.

**Districts (Kreise)**

:   A municipal administrative unit between government regions (where applicable) and municipalities.
    
    The main types of districts:
    
    + Rural districts (Landkreise)
    + Urban districts (kreisfreie Städte), which perform the functions of both districts and municipalities.

**Municipalities (Gemeinden)**

:   The smallest administrative units with extensive self-governing rights. Municipalities are responsible for local administration and are led by an elected municipal council and usually a mayor.

**Municipal Associations (Gemeindeverbände)**

:   Associations of municipalities formed to jointly carry out specific tasks. Municipal associations, such as administrative communities or special-purpose associations, are typically limited to particular administrative functions.
